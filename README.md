## Summary



Our project explores the relationship between home support systems and the health behaviors of high school students in Androscoggin County. Our data comes from a student survey administered across local school districts in the area. We aim to visualize how family support influences students when making healthy or unhealthy life choices. Specifically, we analyzed self-reported behavior such as smoking, drinking or using drugs in school, and at-home eating habits while examining how supported students felt by their parents. Support is used generally here, meaning academic, health, and social support for their children.

This research is supported by prior findings from the National Institute of Health, which have shown that strong parental involvement can reduce the likelihood of risky behaviors in teens, like smoking cigarettes. Our study aims to test those national findings at a local level in Androscoggin County while including unique variables like gender within this study to understand better how male and female children react to familial support and how they may be affected by unhealthy behaviors like smoking, alcohol, and indicators like being overweight or eating meals with family.

We started off by importing three different datasets together. The first was focused on the number of times students reported being drunk or high at school in the past year. The second reflected responses to a statement about family support, whether a student agreed that “my family gives me love and support.” The third dataset captured behaviors like how often students ate meals with their families, whether they were exposed to smoking in the home, and how frequently they smoked themselves.

Our final merged dataset, final_data, allowed us to compare age, grade, and gender across all three behavioral dimensions. For example, we could look at whether tenth-grade girls who felt supported by their families were more likely to be exposed to smoking at home than eleventh-grade boys.

The findings were very interesting. In one bar graph, we displayed the percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who had been drunk or high in school compared to those who reported high levels of parental support. Across every grade, the gap was significant: while only about 10% of students reported being drunk or high at school, over 80% said they felt supported by their families. This suggests that most students perceive a strong emotional safety net, even if a small percentage still engage in risky behavior.

Another visualization compared the age distribution of overweight students to those who said they had strong family support. Here, too, we found that family support remained high across all age groups, even as the percentage of overweight students slightly decreased with age. While not conclusive, this finding raises important questions about whether consistent support helps buffer against negative health outcomes or whether other factors, like socioeconomic status and school resources, might play a stronger role in issues like obesity.

The third visualization compares exposure to secondhand smoke with family meal frequency. Among both males and females, students who reported being in a room where someone smoked at least once in the last seven days were equally likely to have eaten seven meals with their family that week. This correlation was particularly strong in younger age groups, suggesting that early home environments may shape later behavior.

This all points to a simple but powerful idea: students who feel supported at home are less likely to engage in harmful behavior. This does not mean all students with strong families avoid risk, nor does it suggest that support alone can prevent poor health outcomes. However, it does suggest that positive family involvement, especially communication and shared routines like meals, plays a crucial role in creating stability during a time of life that is often anything but stable.

Moving forward, we hope this research can be shared with school counselors, community health professionals, and parents. The more we understand how family environments affect youth behavior, the more we can focus on strengthening those support systems in meaningful, data-informed ways.
