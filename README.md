The Role of Home Support Systems in Youth Health: A Case Study in Androscoggin County

Our project explores the relationship between home support systems and the health behaviors of high school students in Androscoggin County. With data sourced from student surveys administered across local schools, we sought to understand just how influential a student’s sense of familial support is when it comes to making healthy or unhealthy life choices. Specifically, we analyzed self-reported behavior such as smoking, drinking or using drugs in school, and eating habits — all while examining how students responded to questions about the quality of communication and emotional support they receive from their families.

This research is grounded in prior findings from organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, which have shown that strong parental involvement can reduce the likelihood of risky behaviors in teens, particularly in the area of tobacco use. Our study aims to test those national findings at a local level, adding a unique lens by comparing gender differences and layering in multiple types of unhealthy behaviors — not just smoking, but also alcohol use and indicators like being overweight or eating meals with family.

We began by importing and merging three major datasets. The first was focused on the number of times students reported being drunk or high at school in the past year. The second reflected responses to statements about family support — for example, whether a student agreed that “my parents are good at talking with me about things” or “my family gives me love and support.” The third dataset captured behaviors like how often students ate meals with their families, whether they were exposed to smoking in the home, and how frequently they smoked themselves.

Our final merged dataset — final_data — allowed us to compare age, grade, and gender across all three behavioral dimensions. For example, we could look at whether tenth-grade girls who felt unsupported by their families were more likely to be exposed to smoking at home than eleventh-grade boys who reported strong parental communication.

The findings were striking. In one bar graph, we displayed the percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who had been drunk or high in school compared to those who reported high levels of parental support. Across every grade, the gap was significant: while only about 10% of students reported being drunk or high at school, over 80% said they felt supported by their families. This suggests a majority of students perceive a strong emotional safety net, even if a small percentage still engage in risky behavior.

Another visualization compared the age distribution of overweight students to those who said they had strong family support. Here too, we found that family support remained high across all age groups — even as the percentage of overweight students slightly increased with age. While not conclusive, this finding raises important questions about whether consistent support helps buffer against negative health outcomes — or whether other factors, like socioeconomic status and school resources, might play a stronger role in issues like obesity.

One of the more revealing visualizations came from comparing exposure to secondhand smoke with family meal frequency. Among both males and females, students who reported being in a room where someone smoked at least once in the last seven days were also significantly less likely to have eaten 7 meals with their family that week. This correlation was particularly strong in younger age groups, suggesting that early home environment may shape later behavior.

To further explore gender dynamics, we created faceted plots that compared male and female students separately. For both genders, the trend was consistent: more family meals generally correlated with less exposure to smoking. However, males had slightly higher counts in both smoking and meal frequency, suggesting that boys may be more present in environments with both risks and supports simultaneously. Whether that means they’re more likely to eat meals in homes where smoking also occurs, or whether their behavior is less influenced by support structures, is something we hope to explore in a future version of this study.

What this all points to is a simple but powerful idea: students who feel supported at home are less likely to engage in harmful behavior. This doesn’t mean all students with strong families avoid risk, nor does it suggest that support alone can prevent poor health outcomes. But it does suggest that positive family involvement — especially communication and shared routines like meals — plays a crucial role in creating stability during a time of life that is often anything but stable.

Moving forward, we hope this research can be shared with school counselors, community health professionals, and parents themselves. The more we understand how family environments affect youth behavior, the more we can focus on strengthening those support systems in meaningful, data-informed ways.
